ðŸ“¦ React Redux Connectors and Providers

This project explores how to effectively use React Redux connectors and providers in a modern application.
It covers mapping state and actions to components, working with middleware like Redux Thunk, improving performance with Reselect, and debugging using Redux DevTools.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

    Understand Redux connectors and how to use them.

    Learn how to pass functions to connectors:

        mapStateToProps

        mapDispatchToProps

    Map action creators (including async ones) to components using Redux Thunk.

    Set up the Redux Provider and application store.

    Improve connector performance using Reselect.

    Use Redux DevTools to debug state and actions.

ðŸ§  Container vs. Component Pattern

This repo emphasizes the separation of containers (smart components connected to Redux) and presentational components (stateless and purely visual),
ensuring code is clean, testable, and scalable.
